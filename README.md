# Blazor Standalone
A Blazor project for testing out things

## Packages used

[Blazor 0.8.0](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/client-side/spa/blazor/get-started?view=aspnetcore-3.0&tabs=netcore-cli)
[Blazor-Redux 0.0.6](https://github.com/torhovland/blazor-redux)

## Published to GitHub Pages
Using the lovely [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) as static hosting, because it's free.

### Made a Powershell script to push it upstream
Decided to crank out a quick script to generate and push the output from the blazor project.

```Powershell
.\gh-publish.ps1
```
